Course Name: Python for Scientific Computing

Credits: 0-1

Description:

Python has seen wide adoption in the scientific community for data
analysis, simulation, prototyping, and visualization. It provides a
simple, yet powerful means to build applications.  This seminar
introduces python and its use in scientific computing.  Students will
learn the standard python libraries for array manipulation,
visualization, numerical analysis, and symbolic mathematics, as well
as how to interface python with other languages, build applications,
and good software engineering practices (including version control and
testing).  Students are encouraged to share examples from their
discipline.
